# Express TS Starter

Simple express TS starter!

## How to use?

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev # run development!
```

## Scripts

```
$ npm run build # build typescript project
$ npm start # run in development mode
```

## Test

Test are using [vitest](https://vitest.dev/). Don't worry its the same API as Jest! I choose this because this are more easy to setup when using Typescript

```
$ npm test
```
